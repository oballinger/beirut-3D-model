        Blast damage assessment in Beirut is being carried out using
        two-dimensional satellite imagery. These approaches underestimate damage by
        failing to capture damage done to the sides of buildings. I outline an
        alternative approach using Open Street Map data to create a 3D model of Beirut
        and the explosion to analyze directional blast damage.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Satellite Imagery and its Limits</strong></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Following the recent explosion in Beirut, I built a tool that uses Sentinel-2
        imagery to map the destruction caused by the blast. After some trial and
        error, I arrived at a fairly simple two step process: first, measuring the
        change in spectral signatures between pre- and post-explosion images. Second,
        applying an X-Means clustering algorirthm to the resulting image (yielding the
        map on the right), or taking the absolute difference (yielding the map on the
        left):
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Red areas on the left indicate high levels change between the pre- and post-
        explosion images. On the right, the magnitude, direction, and spectral
        characteristcs of the change are used to classify different types of damage;
        green indicates minor changes, red and orange seem to indicate burnt
        areas, while purple areas match places that suffered structural damage. These
        align fairly closely to a damage map of Beirut generated by NASA.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Though satellite imagery analysis is undoubtedly one of the best tools we have
        at our disposal to analyze this sort of phenomenon, it appears to
        systematically underestimate the extent of damage in Beirut.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Below is one of the most viewed videos of the explosion:</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Geolocating this video was pretty simple thanks to the Greek Orthodox church
        (highlighted in green below) and the road leading to it (highlighted in blue).
        The red box indicates the likely location (33.889061, 35.515909) from which
        the person was filming:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The video shows heavy damage being sustained by areas well outside the zones
        classified as damaged in the maps above (both my own and NASA's). Indeed,
        substantial damage was reported several kilometers away.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Why are satellite images underestimating damage in Beirut? Satellite images
        are taken from above, and are two-dimensional. Much of the damage caused by
        the blast, however, was directional; the pressure wave hit the sides of
        buildings, as shown in this diagram from a FEMA manual:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Areas close to the explosion suffered so much damage that it could be seen
        from above, but even if an apartment building had all of its windows blown
        out, this would not necessarily be visible in a top-down view. Even for radar,
        which does technically collect data in three dimensions, the angle problem
        remains; a high resolution radar might be able to tell you how tall an
        apartment complex is, but it won't give you a clear image of all sides. Case
        in point: the NASA damage map was created using Sentinel-1 SAR data. In a
        nutshell, damage assessment in this case is a three-dimensional problem, and
        remote sensing is a two-dimensional solution.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Creating a 3D model of Beirut</p>
      <p>
        To create a more accurate rendering of directional blast damage, three
        dimensional data are required. Data from Open Street Maps (OSM) contains
        information on both the "footprints" (i.e., the location and shape) as well as
        the height of buildings, which is enough to create a three dimensional model
        of Beirut. 3D rendering was done in Blender using the Blender-OSM add-on to
        import a satellite basemap, terrain raster, and OSM data.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Geolocated videos of the blast can be used to verify and adjust the model.
        Below is a side-by-side comparison of the twitter video and a 3D rendition of
        OSM data:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Some slight adjustments to the raw OSM data were made to achieve the image on
        the right. The building footprints are generally very accurate and
        comprehensive in coverage, but the building height data does occasionally have
        to be adjusted manually. A simple and reliable way of doing this is to look at
        the shadows cast by the building on the satellite base map and scale
        accordingly. I also added a rough texture to the buildings to help
        differentiate them, and added the domed roof of the Greek Orthodox church for
        reference.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        For good measure, a second video is geolocated following the same procedure:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The second pier (highlighted in green) and the angle (in blue) serve as
        references:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The video was taken from the rooftop of a japanese restaurant called Clap
        Beirut (in red above). This is confirmed by a picture of the rooftop bar on
        google images, which matches the bar that can be seen at 0:02 in the twitter
        video. Below is a comparison of the video view and the 3D OSM model:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Though somewhat grainy, the basemap on the OSM rendering shows the same
        parking lot in the foreground, the second pier, and the same two buildings
        highlighted in yellow. Having created a 3D model of Beirut using OSM data, we
        can now simulate how the explosion would interact with the cityscape.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Using a Viewshed Analysis to Assess Blast Exposure</p>
      <p>
        As the pressure wave moved through the Beirut, some buildings bore the full
        force of the explosion, while others were partially shielded by taller
        structures. A viewshed analysis can be conducted to identify surfaces that
        were directly exposed to the explosion by creating a lighting object at ground
        zero; areas that are lit up experienced unobstructed exposure to the blast:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Pressure waves, like sound, are capable of diffraction (beding around small
        obstructions). To roughly simluate this, the lighting object is gradually
        raised, allowing the light to pass "around" obstructions. Warehouses on the
        Eastern side of the docks, as well as the first row of apartment buildings
        facing the docks are immediately affected. As the lighting object rises above
        the warehouse, more areas suffer direct exposure.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Using two lighting objects-- a red one at 10 meters and a blue one at 20
        meters above the warehouse at ground zero-- the intensity of the blast in
        different areas is highlighted; red areas suffered direct exposure, blue areas
        suffered partially obstructed exposure, and black areas were indirectly
        exposed.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        In the immediate vicinity of the explosion the large "L" shaped building
        (Lebanon's strategic grain reserve) is bright red, and was barely left
        standing. It absorbed a large amount of the blast, shielding areas behind it
        and thereby casting a long blue shadow to the West. If one refers back to the
        satellite damage maps above, there appears to be significantly less damage in
        the area just West of ("behind") the grain silo, roughly corresponding to the
        blue shadow above. While these areas were still heavily damaged, they seem to
        have suffered less damage than areas of equal distance to the East.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Accounting for Diffraction</p>
      <p>
        The viewshed analysis tells us which sides of a building are exposed to the
        blast, but it's a pretty rough approximation of the way the pressure wave
        would respond to obstacles in its path. As previously mentioned, pressure
        waves behave much like sound waves or waves in water: they bounce off of
        objects, move around obstructions, and gradually fade.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        To get a more precise idea of the way in which the blast interacted with the
        urban environment, we can model the blast as an actual wave using the "dynamic
        wave" feature in Blender. This effectively involves creating a two-dimensional
        plane, telling it to behave like water, and simulating an object being dropped
        into the water. By putting an obstruction in this plane, we can see how the
        wave responds to it. As an example, the grain silo has been isolated below:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        As the blast hits the side of the silo, it is reflected. Two large waves can
        be seen traveling to the right: the initial blast wave, and the reflection
        from the silo which rivals the initial wave in magnitude. To the left, the
        wave travels around the silo but is significantly weakened. A still frame from
        the second twitter video shows the effect of the grain silo on the pressure
        wave:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Broadening the focus and adding the rest of the OSM data back in, we can
        observe how the pressure wave interacted with buildings on the waterfront:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The warehouses on the docks were omitted to emphasize the interaction between
        the pressure wave and the waterfront buildings; their light metal structure
        and low height means they would have caused little reflection anyway. The
        general pattern of the dynamic wave is consistent with the viewshed, but adds
        a layer of detail. The blast is reflected off of the silo towards the East,
        leading to a double hit. Though the wave still moves around the silo to the
        West, the pressure is diminished. Once the wave hits the highrises, the
        pattern becomes noisy as the wave both presses forward into the mainland and
        is reflected back towards the pier.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Modeling the Pressure Wave</p>
      <p>
        Now that we've accounted for the directionality of the blast and the influence
        of buildings, we can model the pressure wave itself. An expanding sphere
        centered at ground zero is used to model the progression of the pressure wave
        through the city. To get a visual sense of the blast's force, the color of the
        sphere will be a function of the pressure exerted by pressure wave.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The pressure exerted by the explosion in kilopascals (kPa) at various
        distances can be calculated using the DoD's Blast Effects Computer, which
        allows users to input variables such as the TNT equivalent of the ordnance,
        storage method, and elevation. Though there are several estimates, the blast
        was likely equivalent to around 300 tons of TNT. The direct "incident
        pressure" of the pressure wave is shown in blue. However, pressure waves from
        explosions that occur on the ground are reflected upwards, amplifying the
        total pressure exerted by the blast. This "reflected pressure" is shown in
        orange:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        For reference, 137 kPa results in 99% fatalities, 68 kPa is enough to cause
        structural damage to most buildings, and 20 kPa results in serious injuries.
        1-6 kPa is enough to break an average window. At 1km, the reflected pressure
        of the blast (18 kPa) was still enough to seriously injure. Precisely
        calculating the force exerted by an explosion is exceptionally complicated,
        however, so these numbers should be treated as rough estimates. Further
        analysis of the damage caused by blasts blast can be derived from the UN's
        Explosion Consequences Analysis calculator which provides distance values for
        different types of damage and injuries.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Linking the values in this graph to the color of the pressure wave sphere
        provides a visual representation of the blast's force as it expands. An RGB
        color scale corresponds to the blast's overpressure at three threshold values:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        By keeping the lighting object from the viewshed analysis and placing it
        within the expanding sphere of the pressure wave, we combine two key pieces of
        information: the pressure exerted by the blast (the color of the sphere), and
        the level of directional exposure (brightness).
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Now, referring back to the two geolocated twitter videos from earlier, we can
        recreate the blast in our 3D model and get some new insights. Below is a
        side-by-side comparison of the first video and the 3D model:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Judging by the twitter video alone, it would be very hard to tell the fate of
        the person filming or the damage caused to the building that they were in.
        However, the 3D model shows that despite having an unobstructed view of the
        explosion, the incident pressure of the pressure wave had decreased
        significtantly by the time it reached the viewing point. The blue-green color
        corresponds to roughly 15 kPa-- enough to injure and break windows, but not
        enough to cause structural damage to the building.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The second twitter video was taken slightly closer to ground zero, but the
        view was partially obstructed by the grain silo:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Though the pressure wave probably exerted more pressure compared to the first
        angle, the partial obstruction of the grain silo likely tempered the force of
        the blast.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Assessing Damage to the Skyline Tower</p>
      <p>
        As a concrete example of how this approach can be used to assess damage (or
        predict it, if one had the foresight), let us consider the Skyline Tower,
        pictured below following the explosion:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        This partial side view shows two faces of the building, labelled "A" and "B"
        above. Side A was nearly perpendicular to the blast, and just 600 m from
        ground zero. Based on the previous modeling, the pressure wave exerted roughly
        40 kPa on this side of the building. The corner where sides A and B meet,
        highlighted in green, shows total destruction of windows, removal of most
        siding panels, and structural damage. The back corner, highlighted in red,
        shows many windows still intact, indicating that the maximum overpressure on
        this side of the building likely didn't exeed 10 kPa. In other words, standing
        on the front balcony would likely have led to serious injury but standing on
        the back balcony would have been relatively safe.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The animation below shows the Skyline Tower as it is hit by the pressure wave,
        with sides A and B labeled:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The bright green color of the pressure wave indicates a strong likelihood of
        structural damage. Side A can be seen taking a direct hit, while side B is
        angled slighly away. Despite not being directly exposed to the blast, it
        likely still took reflective damage from some of the neighbouring buildings.
        Both the incident overpressure indicated by the color of the sphere, as well
        as the relative brightness of sides A and B both correspond closely to the
        observed damage taken by the Skyline Tower.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Further Research</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Though satellite imagery analysis is an indispensable tool in disaster
        response, it has limitations. Urban blast damage in particular is difficult to
        assess accurately because it is highly directional and much of it cannot be
        seen from a bird's eye view. Using free and open source tools, an interactive
        3D model of an urban explosion can be generated, allowing for a highly
        detailed investigation of directional blast damage. This can be achieved in
        three steps:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        First, creating a 3D model of the urban area using Blender and Open Street
        Maps data. Second, conducting a viewshed analysis using lighting objects to
        gauge levels of unobstructed exposure to the pressure wave. Third, modeling
        the explosion using geolocated videos of the event and ordnance calculators.
        For added detail, a dynamic wave analysis can be used to more precisely model
        how the pressure wave interacts with buildings.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Once properly modeled, the explosion can be viewed from any angle in the city.
        The viewshed analysis can be calibrated more finely by ground-truthing various
        damage levels (e.g. broken windows) at different locations. In the absence of
        an official address registry in Beirut, OSM is already being used by the
        Lebanese Red Cross (donate here) to conduct neighborhood surveys assessing
        blast damage. As such, this type of damage analysis can quickly be integrated
        into relief efforts, adapted to model disasters in different cities, and can
        even be used to simulate the destructive potential of hypothetical explosions
        to promote readiness.

            <p>
              CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son
              and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far
              beyond
              the world of known physics.
            </p>

            <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
              created
              in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential
              hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy
              that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a
              prodigiously violent instant.</p>

            <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to
              pole
              and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
              irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in
              the
              ocean.</p>

            <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
            </p>

            <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of
              the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>

            <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with
              telescopes at the South
              Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics

              second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
              colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>

            <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
              whether it could ever be proved.</p>

            <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
              discovery
              of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time
              and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>

            <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space
              with
              its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
              architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
              of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>

            <p><strong>‘As Big as It Gets’</strong></p>

            <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond
              the
              reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples
              would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
              general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>

            <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
              said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>

            <p>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
              gravitational waves.”</p>

            <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
              permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the
              surface of the sun.</p>

            <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of
              Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
              Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>

            <h2>The Theory of Inflation</h2>
            <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe
              expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>

                  mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.</p>

            <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.</p>

            <p>Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite
              confirmation
              in his lifetime.</p>

            <p>“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”</p>

            <p>The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis.
              Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few,
              meeting
              with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry,
              who
              was
              sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.</p>

            <p>“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose
              his
              words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.</p>

            <p>Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of
              inflation,
              known as
              chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a
              Stanford
              colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him
              the
              news.</p>

            <p>Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.</p>

            <p>“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think
              that
              we ordered anything,
              but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.</p>

            <p>Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having
              news like this is the
              best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.</p>

            <p>By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread,
              astrophysicists responded
              with a mixture of jubilation and caution.</p>

            <p>Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it will go
              down as one of the greatest
              discoveries in the history of science.”</p>

            <p>John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project
              called
              the South Pole Telescope,
              pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
            </p>

            <p>Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a pair of
              universes as the cause of genesis,
              said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about
              inflation.</p>

            <p>Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting that
              the
              new results exceeded earlier estimates
              based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and
              other assumptions about the universe.</p>

              other assumptions about the universe.</p>

            <p>“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.</p>

            <p>Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this
              year.
              At least a dozen other teams are trying
              similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.</p>

            <p><strong>Spirals in the Sky</strong></p>

            <p>Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were
              discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and
              Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.</p>

            <p>Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of
              Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly
              sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing
              conditions.
              The others are Clement Pryke of the University of
              Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.</p>

            <p>“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has
              been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994.
              “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.</p>

          <div class="article--center">
            <p>In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the
              light waves had a slight preference to
              vibrate in one direction
              rather than another.</p>

            <p>This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such
              waves,
              squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as
              they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result,
              maps
              of the polarization in the sky should have little
              arrows going in spirals.</p>

            <p>Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of the
              microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting
              thermometer.</p>

            <p>“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>

            <p>The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a
              Harvard
              supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors
              might beat them to the breakthrough.</p>

            <p><strong>A Special Time</strong></p>

            <p>The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his
              Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution
              of the universe.</p>

            <p>Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and
              weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different manifestations
              of a single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.</p>

            <p>As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old folk
              mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force
              after another splitting away.</p>

            <p>That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>

            <p>Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees,
              until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.</p>

            <p>Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that case, space
              itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.</p>

            <p>Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the
              universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more
              space was created, the harder it pushed apart.</p>

            <p>What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold — from a
              submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic
              eye-blink.</p>

            <p>Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All of
              normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and
              stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr.
              Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”</p>

            <p>Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision
              suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable
              homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly,
              a
              concept known as the multiverse.</p>

            <p>So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going any
              deeper
              into the past.</p>

            <p>We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases
              everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away,
              forever out of our view.</p>

            <p>“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part
              of
              the team, “you wind up at inflation.”</p>
